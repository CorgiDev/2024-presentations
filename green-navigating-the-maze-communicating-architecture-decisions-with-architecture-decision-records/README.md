## Abstract

The most commonly asked question in software architecture is why a team used a particular architectural style, set of patterns, technology, etc. Effective communication of architectural decisions is paramount in the ever-evolving landscape of software architecture. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are invaluable for documenting, sharing, and understanding these decisions. Come to this enlightening session and explore the significance of ADRs in facilitating clear and transparent communication within architectural teams.

We will discuss the fundamental principles of ADRs and examine how they capture the rationale, context, and consequences of architectural choices. Through real-world examples and case studies, we will see the practical application of ADRs in various scenarios, from small-scale projects to large, complex systems.

Furthermore, we will discuss best practices for creating, managing, and evolving ADRs throughout a project's lifecycle. From initiation to implementation, learn how to harness the power of ADRs to foster collaboration, mitigate risks, and maintain architectural integrity.

Whether you are a seasoned architect or a budding developer, this session promises to equip you with the knowledge and skills to communicate architecture decisions effectively using ADRs, empowering you to navigate the architectural maze confidently and clearly and be able to answer the question of why today, tomorrow, and in the future.
