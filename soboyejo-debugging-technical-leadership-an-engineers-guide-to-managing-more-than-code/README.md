## Bio

Synthesizing information and making connections is at the heart of most of what I do. I love connecting the dots across so many domains.

From building apps that focus on connecting people and their data to writing articles or speaking at conferences, I use any medium at my disposal to achieve this aim.

You can catch me in my free time using SciKit Learn and PyTorch to tackle NLP challenges. The only thing that tops that is spending time being a husband and father of three amazing kids
