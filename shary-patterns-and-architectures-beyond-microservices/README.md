## Bio

I am a full-stack developer and technical lead that uses Python, JVM languages and Javacript.  I enjoy functional programming, delivering production code as fast as possible and robust automated testing. I work with teams to overhaul their projects, improve code quality, speed delivery to production and improve culture.

I am also working in machine learning and AI to improve areas ability to provide accurate data and supplement gaps with predictions.  I focus on neural networks with Keras and Tensorflow.  I am learning how to productionalize data science to become a platform for companies and departments

## Abstract

Have you slayed the monolith and are ready for more? Learn patterns and architectures that move beyond simple microservices to solve problems of resiliency, security, scalability, responsiveness.  Understand the new class of issues that come with distributed systems like microservices.  We explore modern patterns like CQRS, sidecars, probabilistic development, code as documentation and others.  You will be able to see past the monolith and understand the new problems and patterns that help in modern distributed systems.
