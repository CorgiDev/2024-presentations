## Abstract

Building apps for the cloud has always been hard. Developers are typically pulled away from writing their business logic and what matters most to deal with the complexity of the cloud.

To help simplify cloud app complexity, Microsoft has introduced .NET Aspire.  It includes a curated set of components that make sense to use in your C# projects.

.NET Aspire makes it easy to discover, acquire, and configure essential dependencies for cloud-native apps from the very beginning of your project. 

Join me to walk through the set-up and usage of this new, powerful tool that can make any .NET developer more efficient in delivering cloud-native applications.
