## Abstract

Interviewing needs to be a two-sided conversation and that is exactly what this talk is focused on. My goal is to talk to engineering leaders on processes to put in place to help scale their internal teams more efficiently as well as a 'peel behind the onion' type of talk for job seekers on things to look out for during the interviewing process. This is a conversation about a bunch of topics that are usually not talked about publicly.
