## Abstract

Managing React state is hard. Why? Because there are so many options to consider! Local state, reducers, custom hooks, context, and over a dozen third-party libraries. In this session, we’ll explore the lessons I’ve learned from managing complex state in React over the last seven years. I’ll share my strategy for categorizing React state including local, server, global, derived and many more. After this session, you’ll understand how to identify different types of state, where to declare state, and how to choose between these different options.
