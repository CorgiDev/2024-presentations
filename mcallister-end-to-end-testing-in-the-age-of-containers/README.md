## Bio

Scott McAllister is a Developer Advocate for ngrok. He has been building web applications in several industries for over a decade. Now he's helping others learn about a wide range of web and infrastructure technologies. When he's not coding, writing or speaking he enjoys long walks with his wife, skipping rocks with his kids, and is happy whenever Real Salt Lake, Seattle Sounders FC, Manchester City, St. Louis Cardinals, Seattle Mariners, Chicago Bulls, Seattle Storm, Seattle Seahawks, OL Reign FC, St. Louis Blues, Seattle Kraken, Barcelona, Fiorentina, Borussia Dortmund or Mainz 05 can manage a win.


## Abstract

The aim of automated testing is to give us confidence that our code will run as expected in every situationâ€“especially when we push changes. Good tests will increase your team's velocity of developing new features and reduce the headache of bugs and outages.

 As more applications shift to containerized environments, testing them becomes more complex. This session will clarify setting up and running automated tests in these environments. We'll discuss organizing tests in containers, handling dependencies, and maintaining consistent testing throughout the deployment process. The session will cover setting up Docker for replicable test environments and utilizing Kubernetes to manage complex, interdependent test workflows, ensuring consistent, reliable end-to-end testing.
