## Abstract

Test data is a pernicious issue facing every IT operation. Teams have challenges with stale data, differences with data between environments, referential integrity across systems, generating data dynamically for testing at runtime, having control over their data, or even understanding what data they actually need. The challenge is compounded for large enterprises with complex interconnected systems all overseen by internal compliance and external regulatory bodies. In this presentation, we'll explore the steps you can take to defeat the test data management problem, such as:  
<> access control over test data 
<> identifying the right data to subset for testing 
<> using data to control how tests execute in different environments 
<> avoiding the use of shared data 
<> tooling to both generate and manage test data
