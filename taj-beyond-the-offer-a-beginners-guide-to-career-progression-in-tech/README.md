## Abstract

Abstract:
Imagine this: you're about to hit the one-year mark in your first role as a software engineer. Just a couple of months ago, you were fresh out of college and ecstatic about landing a job at your dream tech company. Now, a year into your career, you feel lost, and the initial thrill has given way to a sense of uncertainty. As you navigate your new role, your manager raises concerns about your performance, and the pressure to secure a promotion within a specific time frame looms large.

This scenario isn't unique; many of us face similar challenges in our tech careers. There's no guidebook handed to us at the start, and the path to becoming a senior software engineer can be daunting.
