## Bio

Guy works for Redis as a Developer Advocate. Combining his decades of experience in writing software with a passion for learning—and for sharing what he has learned—Guy explores interesting topics and spreads the knowledge he has gained around developer communities worldwide.

Teaching and community have long been a focus for Guy. He runs his local JavaScript meetup in Ohio and has served on the selection committees of numerous conferences. He'll happily speak anywhere that will have him and has even has helped teach programming at a prison in central Ohio.

In his personal life, Guy is a hard-boiled geek interested in role-playing games, science fiction, and technology. He also has a slightly less geeky interest in history and linguistics. In his spare time he likes to camp and studies history and linguistics.

## Abstract

I’ve written a rather silly thing using AI and JavaScript that finds Bigfoot using Semantic Search. In this session I’ll show it to you, and show you how to build your own—all using local models, local databases, and local code—and without plopping down a credit card to use cloud APIs.

I’ll show you the code I used to trigger a Semantic Search. Not sure what Semantic Search is? Well, it uses embeddings to search for what you intended as opposed to keywords. This lets it understand the context of your request. Not sure what embeddings are? An embedding is a very carefully crafted vector created using an AI model. How can vectors do that? Guess you’re gonna have to come and find out!

If that’s not enough, I’m using buzzwords like: LLM, LangChain, Hugging Face, Redis, and Vector Database. Now you have to check it out.

So come for the buzzwords, stay for the fun, and leave with the knowledge you'll need to build something fun, useful, or both.
