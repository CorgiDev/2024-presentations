## Bio

I've worked in software development for 15+ years (mostly Microsoft technologies) and love the problem solving aspect of the work. In recent years I have become very passionate about AI and machine learning technologies and how they can be applied to different aspects of our lives. When not coding I enjoy spending time with my family, soccer (watching, playing, and coaching), playing videogames and watching movies. 

## Abstract

Infrastructure as Code allows organizations to provision resources in an automated, consistent and repeatable manner. Terraform is one of the most popular tools because of its ability to deploy resources to multiple cloud and SaaS providers.

In this talk, we will learn the basic structure of a Terraform project as well as the language syntax. We will then create the files needed to deploy a web application to the cloud via the command line. Finally, we will create a CI/CD pipeline to deploy our resources and code.

Whether you are new to infrastructure as code or you are looking to add a new tool to your toolbelt you will leave this season with everything you need to automate your resource deployment with Terraform.
