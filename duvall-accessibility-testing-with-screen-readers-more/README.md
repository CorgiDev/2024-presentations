## Bio

Everyone has their niche in the world where they find the most joy and fulfillment. For me that has become Accessibility. Some of my experience comes from my personal ordeals I have gone through as I have steadily learned more about what makes my brain tick and what makes my joints throw a temper tantrum. My professional experience has helped me along the way because it is where I learned just how diverse the options were for accommodations, treatment, and more.

I was initially thrown into the deep end during my amazing journey with the American Printing House for the Blind's Internal IT department. I gained insight to some of the struggles caused when environments, processes, technology, and attitudes are not accessible. However, I also experienced great joy every time I managed to help make someone's day easier by helping them be more independent and confident in themselves. Since then, I have held many other Accessibility related roles and made it my mission to spread Accessibility awareness. I've done so through by improving Code Louisville's Accessibility policies and coursework as a mentor, speaking at domestic & international events, providing support online, and so much more. I plan to continue to do what I can for as long as I am able.

## Abstract

Accessibility Testing is an interesting process involving a mixture of automated and manual testing methods with a variety of tools. You may have an Accessibility test plan together, but now you need the tools to put it to use.

In this session, we'll do a high-level view of how we can use screen readers in mobile and desktop environments to identify how accessible content is. Additionally, we'll look into a few other tools that can be used like browser extensions, bookmarklets, and desktop applications.
