## Bio

Hi I'm Brandon. I'm a problem solver at heart, and my medium is software. I've spent the last 18 years in the software industry helping to make a positive impact in the lives of my customers. I've been developer, technical lead, solution architect, cloud architect, manager and mentor. In my current role I manage a team of around 100 engineers spread across 15 or so projects and the entire country.

I believe that, in our industry, we have a huge potential to create positive impact. It's really hard to change the world, but as Software Engineers, we can change the world for someone. The moment when you can use technology to show someone that the problem they've been dealing with for years can truly be better is an amazing experience, and I love sharing my passion for making impact with others in our community.

## Abstract

Software architecture has a contentious reputation in the agile community. It is often seen as the cause of expensive, valueless meetings and stacks of documentation that no one ever reads. And yet, applications with poor architecture quickly devolve into buckets of technical debt, with the teams that work on them destined for feelings of stress and frustration. But my friends, this is not the way...

For software architects to be effective in a world dominated by phrases like "Agile Development" and "Product Mindset", they must be seen as an enabler of business growth, a force multiplier, and a catalyst for innovation. In this talk you will learn:

* What software architecture is, what an architect does, and why it's so difficult to define
* Embracing change with Evolutionary Architectures
* Ways to influence software architecture outside the codebase
* How to instill an architectural mindset in software development teams

In today's agile world, software architecture still plays a critical role. If you're considering software architecture as a potential next step in your professional journey, join us and learn how to be effective in the role.
