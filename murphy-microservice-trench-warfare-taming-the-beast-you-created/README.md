# Microservice Trench Warfare - Taming the Beast you Created

Heath Murphy &mdash; *VP, Consulting Services for CGI*

## Bio

Architect, Developer, PM and Pumpkin Ale expert but not necessarily in that order. Heath has been a leader in the IT industry for over 20 years and has presented at multiple conferences around the great lakes region. Heâ€™s from Columbus, Ohio and therefore bleeds scarlet and grey, Go Buckeyes! These days, he works as a director and people leader for CGI, one of the largest IT and business consulting services firms in the world. Racing fast cars, building stupid expensive gaming computers, and manicuring a perfect home lawn round out his hobbies.

## Abstract

Incoming Grenade! Hope your architecture can handle that blow. No? Come on in and learn how a self healing microservices architecture can make you bullet proof. No more 2:00 AM calls that production is down. I'll walk you through a large scale Microservices system we built and how we weathered the blows. Patterns that work, war stories from the trenches. We'll laugh and we'll cry as I describe the tactics, tips and tricks you need to run a successful Microservice based system. Circuit breakers, Partitioning/bulk heads, CQRS are just a few topics we cover with real world examples you can take back with you.
