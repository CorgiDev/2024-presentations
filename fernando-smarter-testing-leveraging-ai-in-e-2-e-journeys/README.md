## Abstract

Today, using AI in your end-to-end (E2E) tests is more important than ever. Web apps are getting more complex, and users expect them to work perfectly. Traditional testing methods are not fast or accurate enough anymore. By adding AI to E2E testing, we can find and fix problems faster to keep us ahead in the market.

Incorporating AI with popular testing tools like Cypress and Playwright can significantly enhance the efficiency of E2E testing. AI's capability to generate test cases based on actual user interactions ensures that our testing is not only thorough but also aligned with real-world scenarios. This talk will dive into concrete ways AI can augment these tools, elevating their functionality.

Join me to explore the transformative impact of AI in your E2E testing process. You will learn strategies to leverage AI, improving your testing framework, and consequently, the quality of your web applications.
