## Abstract

Are you engaged in a digital transformation initiative, working to retire systems as part of a merger and integration project, or sunsetting a legacy product?

If so, then invest an hour to learn about the Minimum Viable Replacement framework before you potentially waste thousands of hours and millions of dollars pursuing the wrong strategy for retiring and replacing existing systems. 

 You will learn:
1.  Why the Minimum Viable Product framework fails miserably when attempting to replace legacy systems.
2. The math behind why it’s impossible to accurately estimate scope, costs and timelines of complex projects.
3. How to identify, quantify and mitigate key risks that most people/organizations overlook.
4. Where to focus your initial UX and architectural research to avoid disastrous surprises toward the end of the project.
5. And much, much more – all delivered via a series of colorful slides, clear examples and sixth-grade math formulas that you can use to impress your boss and colleagues.
